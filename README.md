# Brandon Sanderson Books


## Project Philosophy

This project I really wanted to focus on Client-Side Routing and create a project that could easily move from one page to another. When deciding what to do I was suggested by my Advisor to create my project based on one of my hobbies. 

My favorite past time is to read so my first thoughts were to do it on a ton of books and to try and shift things that way. I didn't want to make my json-server data too complicated though. So I narrowed it down to focus on my favorite author and the books that he has published.
